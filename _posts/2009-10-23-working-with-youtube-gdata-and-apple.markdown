>To be honest, I'm quite disappointed with Apple these days. The YouTube app, and indeed, any youtube support is quite poor. We've been working with private movies for most of the last two weeks and it seems that you simply can't launch the correct links. Fire off a private YouTube link to the App and no joy. <br /><br />To be honest, Google haven't been much better either. Their GData stuff only allows the grabbing of meta-data and not the actual private page or video. This is a real shame as the correct links would indeed work a treat. Not bothered about all the rest of the crappy data... we just want the video!!!<br /><br />Disappointed and haven't had chance to do any graphic design in weeks. Still, there are plenty of photos up on Flickr as S9 has been roving around the nation's capital!
