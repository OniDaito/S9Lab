title: Late Night Coding
---

I've been quite busy of late, again, not with the real job but my *real* job. Recently, I was up in Manchester at the [Amaze](http://www.amaze.com) offices, working solidly for 3 days on a kinect based project for the [Lowry](http://www.thelowry.com). It's still under wraps at the moment but progress has been made. The other partners felt the need to spend time getting the basics nailed. Working piecemeal on a project is only fine for so long. When things need to get done, the tough get going.

For 3 days, there was nothing but drizzle and overcast skies. It's fair to say that Manchester's awful weather actually helps with the Kinect's camera. In bright sunlight, forget it! I never thought I'd be glad to see the greyeness of the north.

To be complete, we tested our setup in the evening also. It turned out that night-time results are better though only marginally.

Testing in Manchester at night does have unique problems. Standing around with a bright *apple* logo attracts a certain kind of person. A bunch of scallies decided to pop over and have a chat. To be fair, we actually learnt a lot - they were playful and wanted to see how the code worked. Some of them had only about 3 teeth which was quite worrying. Neverthess, one of them asked what I'd written the code in. I told him Cinder and he said he had written some basic 'point and click' games at college. I got the impression that secretly, he wanted to be a geek. I hope I've helped him with that.

Since I've caught a cold as well, I'm quite knackered, but if you are in Manchester early next month, be sure to checkout Piccadilly Gardens.
