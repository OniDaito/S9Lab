>Apparently so, according to <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/10/iphone-flash">Wired and Adobe</a>. It seems that, finally, we'll be getting some decent programs and what not for our lovely iPhone. <br /><br />I've been working with the iPhone API for about 2 days and already I'm beginning to get annoyed with it. Objective-C really isn't a nice language but needs must as the devil drives. Actually, the devil had nothing to do with this one. It's always good for a developer to try new things but I can really see where Apple are making the cash here. Unbelievable, it really is. <br /><br />If anyone knows about repeated picture taking with the iPhone, let me know. I, for one, can't wait for Flash CS5 when iPhone support will be available.
