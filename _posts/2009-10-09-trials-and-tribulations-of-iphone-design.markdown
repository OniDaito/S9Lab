>I have to admit, one needs to be really up on their CS to get with the iPhone programming if you want to do anything half interesting. I never realised the draconian rules of Apple were so harsh. Essentially, I'm working with Augmented Reality and that means getting to grips with the camera which is technically illegal. Well, sort of. <br /><br />Annoying, applications like RedLaser, Quickmark and a few others have slipped the net and used the "Screengrab" method to bypass Apple's thought police. I wonder if we can do the same? I mean, come on! Apple have made the ultimate device for proper AR with the 3GS; enough to almost tempt me to buy one! But this sort of thing needs to stop.
