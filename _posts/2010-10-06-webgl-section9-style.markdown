Personally though, I find a lot of them over the top and I'd rather write my own as it's good practice and you get what you want out of it. I started with <a href="http://learningwebgl.com/blog/">the excellent Learning WebGL page</a> which has a stack of lessons in the now familiar NeHe format (God Bless NeHe). So far, my little framework is going well, if a little slowly. Having to do things asynchronously and with events is not something I'm used to as OpenGL and C++ programming generally isn't built that way. Nevertheless, it's been a lot of fun. <br /><br />So far, shaders and basic primitives are supported with ease, along with a manager to manage these resources. There are 4 methods to override in the html page and thats it. I decided to use JQuery and JQueryUI as I am more familiar with that than prototype or similar. It works quite well in the main but much to do yet.<a href="http://github.com/OniDaito/S9WebGL"> I've put the source up on GitHub</a> so people can shout at me when I do things wrong.
