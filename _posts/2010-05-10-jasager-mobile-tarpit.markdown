Word is, it kinda works but the bandwidth is a little limiting. The general deal is that Jasager is great but you really need some kind of connection to get any sort of man-in-the-middle action and thats a shame...unless you already have some shiny GPRS goodness! That does kinda work well. <br /><br />There are a few caveats though. Forwarding http requires a SOCKS proxy daemon process of some kind. Transocks is good and proxychains is better but what if you want to do DNS as well? Write a wrapper around the proxyresolv script and foward DNS traffic to it and you are in. Its awkward but it does work!
