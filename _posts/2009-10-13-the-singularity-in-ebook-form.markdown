>I tend to enjoy reading eBooks these days. Most of them are free, enjoyable and read well on the iPhone. E-Reader is pretty good for these with non-jailbroken iPhones. I'd also suggest that people check out <a href="http://www.manybooks.net">manybooks.net</a>. It's a great little website and seems to be touted by various softwares and people.<br /><br />There's been a lot of talk about the "Singularity" which is quite interesting. As Section9 is very much in the "cyberpunk" of design, we like this sort of thing. I found several fictional works on the subject, not least "<a href="http://manybooks.net/titles/munroejother05everyoneinsilico.html">Everyone in Silico</a>" which I'm looking forward to getting into. <br /><br />Often, people think that a computing singularity will end up devouring the Earth and taking over, benign or evil or something. I always preferred Ghost in the Shell's middle route of co-existence and co-progression. Still, Masamune Shirow was ahead of his time.
