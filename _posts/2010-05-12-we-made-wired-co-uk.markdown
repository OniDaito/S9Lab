The little Oxfam project of which I have played my part has managed to get coverage in Wired.co.uk! It's one step closer to the dream of actually being published in WIRED. Essentially, I've spent a lot of time in the back of the Oxfam shop playing with RFID wands, Bluetooth readers, Amplifiers and all that sort of thing. <br /><br />Essentially, the project is about replaying the tales people have about the objects they donate to the store. Its a pretty neat idea. My role has been about the tech; from writing iPhone software to soldering up readers in the back-room!<br /><br />Emma, the Oxfam store manager has been really cool in putting up with me and my soldering iron. So far things are looking good and I hope to get some good coverage of the event up here.
