Living in London and taking a trip out to the 'cantree' and visiting Bath!?!? What have I become? Nevertheless, have D100 will travel.

I spend most of my time with the prime and the wide but I guess it's good to play with new things once in a while. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/sets/72157624664483615/with/4919371653/">The full set is over on Flickr</a>.</span>
