So here is the first result of my new little Spycam. I bought <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Spy-Key-Chain-Camera-DVR-Covert-Video-Audio-Recorder-/110468930888?cmd=ViewItem&pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19b8761d48">one of these little cameras from eBay</a> and decided that what I really wanted was a longer life-time. So with the use of an optocoupler, an ATTiny13, a buspirate, EAGLE and some etching treatment, here is the resulting video. Its around 3 and a half hours at the moment with two lipoly batteries. I'll post some instructions on how to make your own at some point. So far, it works ok but I'm hoping to get a full 8 hours if possible.
