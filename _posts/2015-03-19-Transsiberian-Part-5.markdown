Despite sounding like something a comic book character would say, Kazan is also a town! It is one of the major towns of Tatarstan which has had an interesting relationship with Russia over the years. Despite their bid for independence they are still part of the Russian Federation. 

The sleeper train from Moscow is a little easier this time. I've got my eye mask and ear plugs, so things go a little smoother. We share our cabin with a Russian man who seems pleasant enough but we make no conversation, as is the custom it seems. The carriage has a few more of the things you'd expect: a samovar (hot water boiler), a large provodnitsa cabin and some brutal looking toilets.

In the morning, we finally get to see some real snow! In St Petersburg and Moscow there were a few mountds of snow lying about here and there but finally, we get to see the real deal! We've both packed thermal boots which make your feet sweat a lot if it's too warm. I was beginning to think they'd be a constant pain. Not now though.
