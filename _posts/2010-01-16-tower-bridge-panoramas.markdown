>Last weekend, I mentioned some shots of Tower Bridge. I've finally got a couple uploaded. They are quite different. The first is taken from St Katherine's Docks which is a fairly cool place to be. It is only about 3Meg in size though there are blemishes here and there but for an overall result, it's not too bad. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.section9.co.uk/panorama1.html">You can view the first one here.</a><br /><br />The second was much more ambitious. I decided to stand right in the middle of Tower Bridge and take a full panorama as a HDR image. This one weighs in at a hefty 23Meg and is a beast to download but nontheless, is pretty darn cool!<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.section9.co.uk/panorama2.html">You can view the first one here</a>, so long as you have a fast connection!
