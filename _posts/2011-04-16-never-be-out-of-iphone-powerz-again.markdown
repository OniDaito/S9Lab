I've been hacking at this project for a while and never managed to get it finished, until now!<br /><br />Its a good lesson in...well...something I think. Im not sure what. I mean, I almost had it working, then bought the wrong fitting parts, never got a decent lipoly, burnt one board with a lipoly, then had no access to a laser cutter for ages and when I did, thanks to Fablab Manchester, it was somewhat different and weird from the one I was used to. Overall, a lot of energy was spent into something you can buy now for around thirty quid. I didnt learn a lot about electronics either. <br /><br />But that all said, I had fun putting it together and I'm glad it works (so far!). I would urge everyone to make one of these. The advantage is, if i get bored, I can use the bits in something else and indeed, its a modular system because I can, if I want, add more batteries easily, use a different panel or charge other devices. It will actually take a wall wart adaptor as well so there is scope for improving easily. <br /><br />We shall see how it keeps up with me as I break things very easily! :D
