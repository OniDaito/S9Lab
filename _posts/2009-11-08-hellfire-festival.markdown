>Recently took some shots at the <a href="http://www.hellfirefestival.com/">Hellfire Festival</a> for <a href="http://www.roomthirteen.com">RoomThirteen</a>; the premier online rock magazine! :D These guys have been really kind to me over the years so I try my best to get some good shots for them. The Hellfire Festival was a bit of a let down though. It felt more like a conference at the end of the day, being as it was held inside the NEC. Very odd having carpet underneath you when listing to metal.<br /><br />Traveling up to Birmingham was not fun. Missed the first train and then had to pay loads to get another. Had to return on the last train full of football fans, to Camden where the local night lunatic roam. Urgh.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.senser.co.uk/">Senser</a> saved the day though. Despite having to leave before their set finished, they played "State of Mind" early on which made my night!<br /><br />Anyways, the entire set can be found on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/sets/72157622637605181/">Section9 Flickr - Hellfire Set</a> page.
