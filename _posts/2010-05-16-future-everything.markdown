The festival was held up in Manchester and we got to install "Tales of Things" into the Oxford Road Oxfam shop.<br /><br />The idea was for people to come in and leave stories about their donated objects. When people came into the shop to browse their objects they would be given a wand to scan the objects and here the tales of their past.<br /><br />It worked a treat and Oxfam managed to sell most of the items we tagged up!<br /><br />The technical side of things were quite interesting. We used both the RFID iPhone box with Audioboo and a bluetooth RFID reader built into a makerbot-style plastic wand. The setup was quite simple but had a few challenges to beat, not least was the A-Team style repair on one of the readers' bluetooth modules. We had to put together a few wands in quick time and make sure everything worked 'in-the-field' without a run through. It was fun and I think the peeps who came into the shop had a good time.
