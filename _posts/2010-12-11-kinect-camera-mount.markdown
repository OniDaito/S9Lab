Because of it's range and other considerations, mounting on a tripod is useful. Using gaffer tape is cool, but laser cutting your own is much cooler! I've posted the files and instructions on thingiverse: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5110">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5110</a><br /><br />This is the first version and it needs a little work but the basics are there.<br /><br />The files provided allow you to cut out two pieces on a laser cutter from either 6mm or 8mm acrylic. MDF probably won't be strong enough as these prongs are designed to clip into the bottom of the kinect's base.<br /><br />If you look at the bottom of the Kinect you'll see it has two holes for a clip. Matching the first piece is designed to slot into these holes. The second piece forms a cross shape for stability.<br /><br />Once you have cut these out, glue together and then attach a third, circular piece. This needs to be tapped with the correct thread for your camera mount, then glued to the first cross section. Getting the right tap could be tricky. The one I used was close but not totally correct. 8mm Perspex seems to work quite well. 6mm might be too thin for the circular base but is fine for the actual clip.
