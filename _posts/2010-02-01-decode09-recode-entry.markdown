Really, there was absolutely no reason for me not to enter this compo. In fact, I've had a few more ideas since. Processing is a good little language to play in and the original code is quite a joy to play with. I figured learning a little about a "Sketch" renderer was a good idea. I must admit, there are some impressive Sketch Shaders out there. I settled for using the NPR Quake one. I hope this makes it onto the Underground. If you are in London and you see this being shown on a projector, let me know!
