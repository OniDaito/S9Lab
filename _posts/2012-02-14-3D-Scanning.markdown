title: 3D Scanning with 123D Catch
---

I've been interested in scanning things of late. There is a job I'm chasing that may potentially involve 3D scanning and as a project, it encompasses many things I like. So I decided to give [123D Catch]() a go, as it seems to be quite good from what people have posted online. Sadly, I've not had so much luck with it.

Apparently, one needs to rotate a camera around the object you want to scan, so I did just that, building a little rig out of a bicycle wheel, just like this.

Mounted around the rim, I placed the Logitech C910 that I use for good work. The results look like this:

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-KmUcCcHuoE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-KmUcCcHuoE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

You can, of course, just spin the thing and record video. That looks quite cool actually!

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Lips-BBa138?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Lips-BBa138?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

The problem is, the results just arent that impressive. Only the hat actually came out right.

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RQHA57jadsY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RQHA57jadsY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

So I thought, maybe I'm being too clever. Lets just use some actual DSLR snaps as people seem to suggest. The best I managed was half a pig!

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZVU8vY8BRc4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZVU8vY8BRc4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

<object width="420" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/i2bnaICown4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/i2bnaICown4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

So basically, a thumbs down for 123D catch. I suspect laser scanning or improved Kinect code is the way forward here.
