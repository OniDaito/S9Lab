Panic! Dispair and calamaty! My slippers have gone missing! It's essential to have a pair of comfy slippers for long hauls on trains for sure! It makes things like going to the loo actually possible without feeling like you've stood on caltrops! Fortunately, the Provodnitsas are very good salespeople. Seeing that I was sans slippers, I was immediately handed a pair and asked for 200 Rubles (Â£2 roughly). Not a bad price at all I thought.

We are heading to Yekaterinburg via a 14 hour (roughly) day train. We are travelling third class which means there are no cabins and although the bunk layouts are sort of similar, there is a third bunk on the opposite side of the train. All of these fold down or away to make for tables and chairs. We are sharing our small spot with the first, *cliche* Russian we have encounted; an early forties, bored, non-english speaking chap who has been drinking non-stop from a cheap looking, plastic, 1.5 litre beer bottle. Stay classy Russia!

He certainly seems enamoured with my Yuri Gagarin t-shirt. In fact he finds not only that, but my camera, my laptop and especially our handpresso coffee maker quite funny. We try to communicate somewhat but it doesn't really work so well, so both Katie and I try and bunker down and ignore the chap as best we can. At one point he suggests we all go to the dining cart together. We politely refuse. He goes to sleep.

Yekaterinburg is quite special because it's the first stop in Asia. Past the Ural mountains we leave European Russia - Europe full stop - and enter Asia. It's also special because this is where we meet the *classic* Transsiberian Railway. So far we've planned our own route to take in a few places we thought were more interesting, but from this town onwards, it's classic Transsiberian all the way to Irkutsk.

Unlike a lot of travellers I do like to bring a lot of technology with me. I like to have a few projects on the go. For train, I have a camera on a suction cup, recording the journey as it unfolds; the plan being to create a slitscan poster of the trip potentially. We also have a backup phone that is attempting to record GPS though it really only works when the train comes to a stop at the stations and I move to one of the doors.
