>I'm mostly a cyber-punk kind-of guy as is fairly obvious really. However, I do so like a little Steampunk now and then. It turns out that there is a really good exhibition over in Oxford, UK. I went to see it today with the family and it turned out to be a lot of fun. Check it out at <a href="http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/steampunk/">http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/steampunk/</a>. Should be running for a few more months yet.
