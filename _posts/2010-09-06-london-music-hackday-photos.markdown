I'd never been to a hackday before, but I was glad I finally got around to it. I spent most of the time helping out in the hardware room where we had quite a few good hacks. Coverage of the day and all the projects are available at <a href="http://london.musichackday.org/2010/">http://london.musichackday.org/2010/</a> and my photos are all up at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/section9">http://www.flickr.com/people/section9</a></span>
