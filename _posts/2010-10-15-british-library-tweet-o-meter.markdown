Originally created by <a href="http://www.stevenjamesgray.com/">Steven Gray</a>, the Tweet-o-meters have emerged into the real world. Im quite proud of how it's all gone and, despite my bitching, Easy Tiger Creative did a good job on the finish. The evening was quite interesting; far too many people in suits and not enough lab-coats in my opinion. Still, it's great to see your creations come to life. Thanks also go to my boss, <a href="http://www.digitalurban.org">Andy Hudson-Smith</a>, who's excellent salesmanship got us in there in the first place.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TLgbfrZERlI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/LGOcD033Gjk/s1600/DSC_4870.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TLgbfrZERlI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/LGOcD033Gjk/s320/DSC_4870.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528198773635040850" /></a><br /><br />Steven's meters provide a JSON file, which my Ruby script pulls down and parses. With a modified version of the Arduino Gauges program by <a href="http://russ.garrett.co.uk/">Russ Garett</a>, two Arduinos and a load of soldering later, the tweet-o-meters accurately rate the Twitter activity in 9 cities around the world.<br /><br />A full set of photos is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/5081948641/">available on my Flickr Page</a>.<br /><br />The exhibition is due to run for 9 months and is free. Please go and check it out if you are near Kings Cross. You'll love it!
