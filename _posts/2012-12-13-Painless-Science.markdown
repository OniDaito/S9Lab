title: Phantom Limb at the Science Museum
---

Im quite excited to see this display. At the back of the Science Museum, in the
Antenna area, there is a new exhibition called
[Painless](http://painlessexhibition.wordpress.com/) that deals with the
new ways researchers are tackling pain.

The display features four different projects that cover the spectrum of odd
pain-relief. My area focused on the phantom-limb syndrome. One delt with how
pain is and isnt remembered. The third was concerned with spider venom and it's
uses in not feeling any pain, whereas the final piece talks about volunteering to aid pain research.

The displays feature a short video and some of the objects that are invovled.
In our case, there are 3 objects in the central case; a kinect, a replica hat
and a pair of vuzix glasses. On the far left is a prosthetic arm and on the
right, a feature object - in this case, a mirror box. This layout
is repeated for each of the stations. Overall, I felt the layout was quite
good.

About half-way through the video, you can see me, with my ubiquitous hat on,
programming in the background, furiously, on my mac! The day the science museum
came to the department was quite good fun. It was certainly interesting to see
a film crew from the otherside.

Im glad to see some of my work in a museum. I think this is one of the works
I'm most proud of because it does seem to have some effect in making someone's
life a little better, physically and measurably, which doesn't happen often in
computer graphics.

Next time, I'll bring a better camera than my iPhone! :D
