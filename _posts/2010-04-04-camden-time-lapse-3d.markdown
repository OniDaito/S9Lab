To be honest though, I don't think it's panned out as well as I'd hoped. The method is not so good for the time spent. Taking 400 photos at full RAW with a tripod for 2 hours....well... the footage was less than ample. Getting a full area time lapse is quite hard so I suspect the easier and more pro method would be to work out your angles and shots before hand. Get say, 3 angles and then work it in in post. Still, I'd love to get some feedback from peeps.
