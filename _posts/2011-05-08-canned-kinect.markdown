introtext: So I've been working out how to do live Mocap with real models for a while now and I think I've finally got it. It still has trouble tracking based on factors I'm not sure about (the lab coat certainly doesnt help). The way that the arms snap back to their default positions when the tracking is lost is not a very good feature either but nevertheless, its definitely live mocap, thanks to the excellent work by the primesense team. Awesome!
