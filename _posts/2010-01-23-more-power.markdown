>Yes indeed, more power. But power does indeed corrupt! Or rather, it makes you lazy! :P Still, I had a lot of fun generating some more renders of London. The dataset is massive and exporting to Sunflow took a long time in places. Still, it was an interesting experiment if nothing else.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S1tLUFbn5uI/AAAAAAAAAl0/bpPa1v6p89k/s1600-h/london1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 273px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S1tLUFbn5uI/AAAAAAAAAl0/bpPa1v6p89k/s320/london1.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5430016584152770274" /></a><br /><br />Similar to the first one I posted. Unlike the previous, this was done on an I7. 231160 primitives and 22 minutes of Render time <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S1tLi0b1fpI/AAAAAAAAAl8/1D5C-hEl3k0/s1600-h/london2.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 160px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S1tLi0b1fpI/AAAAAAAAAl8/1D5C-hEl3k0/s320/london2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5430016837288296082" /></a><br /><br />Yes, I trimmed off a few too many tiles here which is a shame. Still, its a nice result. 704279 primitives and 1 and a half hours render time on an I7 processor.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S1tL_CRmcPI/AAAAAAAAAmE/4uaeBFjV4ns/s1600-h/london3.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S1tL_CRmcPI/AAAAAAAAAmE/4uaeBFjV4ns/s320/london3.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5430017322039800050" /></a><br /><br />53 Tiles were used for the generation of this image. 3052642 primitives were involved. The Render took just shy of 4 hours although the export to Sunflow format from Max took almost as long. TBH, I could have gotten away with a lot less.
