><span class="bblack">Yup, I've been busy with a few side projects. I've been working for a wise man on site in Covent Garden for an interesting little event that seems to involve the colour green an awful lot. Can't say much more than that at the moment! :D</span><br /><span class="bblack">On the other side of things, I'm off to Sonisphere tomorrow so keep your eyes peeled!
