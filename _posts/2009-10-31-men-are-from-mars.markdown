I saw a good tutorial in the latest edition of Computer Arts magazine and really wanted to learn the techniques. This photo came from the festish shoot I had taken part in and this was the idea I really wanted to convey.<br /><br />For me, the green dress speaks of Flash Gorden and sexy alien women and all that sort of thing. I had asked the model to pose this way since it meant I could get the 'flying' space effect.<br /><br />Makes a nice change from iPhone programming and screwing around with soldering irons! :P<br clear="all" />
