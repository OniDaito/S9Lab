Unlike Leeds 2009, I had to camp out and keep everything with me at all times. I don't recommend using an ASUS EeePC and a USB stick to backup your images. I lost a few doing that when I ran out of space. It's not economical to upgrade or buy more spares for my D100 so I decided to simply copy the photos over each day. Not a good idea! Also, I you have a friend who has a press pass, make sure you take your charger with you as your press buddy can charge batteries!</span><br /><span class="bblack">I'm still a huge fan of the Nikon 50mm Lens. It's the best! At 1.8f you can make a lot of mistakes with the depth but it still seems to be the only lens fast enough to grab the action. I rented a Sigma 2.8f 70-200mm from <a href="http://www.fixationuk.com/Fixation/Fixation%20-%20Home/Fixation%20-%20Home.html">Fixation</a> (who so far have been ok - touch wood) and although it helped, I don't think I'd use one again. With being so close to the action, the 50 and my Tokina 11-16 2.8f seemed to work much better. Again though, catching the action is hard work and I still have much to learn.</span>
