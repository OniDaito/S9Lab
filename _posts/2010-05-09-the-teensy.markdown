For these who havent heard of this, its a small little board that is similar to an Arduino but actually registers itself as a Human Interface Device. Basically, you can use it to emulate a keyboard that <span style="font-style:italic;">types itself very fast</span>. You don't need to be a security guru to see the fun you can have.<br /><br />I decided to follow <a href="http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/programmable-hid-usb-keystroke-dongle">Iron Geek's setup</a> and go for the ugly, dip switch, shrink-sleeved version as the black kinda looks evil and cool, plus wiring it up was quite easy. You obviously can't program this thing in exactly the same way as an Arduino but the software is quite good and the form factor of this little thing is really cool!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S-cZqb_Ja2I/AAAAAAAAApU/180WSQiQ1dE/s1600/IMG_0020.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/S-cZqb_Ja2I/AAAAAAAAApU/180WSQiQ1dE/s320/IMG_0020.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5469368489322572642" /></a><br /><br />Doesn't look like much but basically, its a Teensy board ($18) with a USB attachment, an IC Socket and a dipswitch. Pretty straight forward. Using the switches we can get a good range of different programs. I didnt bother with the LED just yet. Figured I'd start simple and see where it goes.<br /><br />There is a whole community around this, started by Hak5 and you can <a href="http://www.hak5.org/forums/index.php?s=761271293b4d117e0e5eda4db79db302&showforum=56">check it out over on their forums</a>.
