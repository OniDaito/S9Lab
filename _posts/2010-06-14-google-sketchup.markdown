Its always a good idea to use the tape-measure tool to lay out where you are making your holes. Click and then before you do anything else, type the measurement in the bottom right. Took me ages to get this sorted but it seems to work great now.<br /><br />Drilling holes ion perspex is a tricky business; it has a tendency to melt. Using white spirit with your pillar drill works a bit but it's hard work. Nevertheless, the animation10 button continues to improve!
