>I've had a bit more of a play with the 10.5mm lens and the panoramic head that work has very kindly loaned me. After freezing my ass off for almost and hour I managed to get some shots I'm quite proud of. Sadly, I can't quite embed the Quicktime MOVs into amny particular page very easily. When I find a proper Panorama site or a good place to upload on my site, I shall do so as they are much better viewed in the correct viewer. However, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/">check out the statue shots on my Flickr Page.</a>
