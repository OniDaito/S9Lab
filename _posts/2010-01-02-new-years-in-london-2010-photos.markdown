>Decided to return to the Southlands of the UK for New Year's. Several bars in Camden, Japanese stores and Korean cafes later, I ended up on Primrose Hill for a large party and a terrific view of the capital. Sadly, I was sans camera which sucked somewhat. Still, there turned out to be a parade on new year's day, passing through Trafalgar Square and Westminster. A great opportunity to learn about taking shots in massive crowds! No press pits here. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/sets/72157622997402307/">Check out the latest snaps on Flickr</a>.<br /><br />Heres a sneak preview!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/Sz-QsCuWoAI/AAAAAAAAAi8/CABQ4_0sRVE/s1600-h/DSC_0709.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 213px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/Sz-QsCuWoAI/AAAAAAAAAi8/CABQ4_0sRVE/s320/DSC_0709.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422211562697302018" /></a>
