Each year, schools enter a animation competition, with winners announced at a special exhibition and event held at the <a href="http://www.thelowry.com/">Lowry in Salford</a>. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.talesofthings.com">Tales of Things</a> has been asked to take part with an interactive stand where children can learn about interesting computing objects and record their own tales of the day. I've been asked to run with this and pretty much re-invent tales of things for a mobile installation. Sounds like a lot of fun.<br /><br />I've had plenty of time sketching things out, as you can see from the image above. So far, the basics are more or less in place. I've had some issues with sticker printing under OSX but Linux seems to play nice, plus Linux has the awesome <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">mencoder</a> package for compressing video, so when the kids record their tales, we can get some nice HTML5 compliant pages built on-the-fly.<br /><br />Wondering about the overall look of the setup. Personally, I'm inclined to go down the 1950s route of sepia, big microphones and steam-punk style cameras. We'll have to scout around eBay for some nice bits. <br /><br />More to come as the work progresses.
