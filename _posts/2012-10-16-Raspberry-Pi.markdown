title: The Obligatory RaspberryPi Post
---
Yes indeed! Basically, anyone in the tech sector who hasn't heard about the
Raspberry Pi really needs to consider their chosen field. Any of these who
haven't blogged about it - well done! There was a spate of *ohmagerd! Im
lighting up my LED over the internet with a Raspberry Pi and YOU DONT HAVE
ONE!* Now the rage is over, I feel I can share my build at last.

So yes, this is the classy pi. I've enclosed it inside an amazing frame my
girlfriend and I found on ebay. The plan is to create somthing we actually like
looking at, that fits the aesthetic of our flat. Sure, an iPad is a thing, but
I want to stare at some lovely art, know what the weather will be like and can
I go out and use my telescope tonight - all whilst drinking my coffee in my
morning slippers. This is that thing!

The build uses a wooden frame mounted onto a spare, 15" flat panel. Im using a
DVI to HDMI convertor, an HTC Desire charger (or something similar), a 4 Gig
Compact Flash with the latest Raspbian and a laser cut plastic enclosure. Im
also using a WiFi USB dongle. The setup is:
 
 [DWA-110 USB Dongle](http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripheralsWorking_USB_Wifi_Adapters)
 
 Any of the power supplies like the iPod, iPhone, HTC Desire or similar. 1A at 5 Volts is good

 [Built to Spec Raspberry Pi Lasercut case](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25100) - this is the best I've found
and gives a lovely result if you have access to a laser cutter

I had awful problems getting the thing to run for longer than about 10 minutes.
In the end, after trying several cards, power supplies and the rest, I returned
the Pi and received a working one that has no problems.

I've so far, not written the software for it though I've had a play with
cameras and I can say that the PS3 Eyetoy and the Logitech C910 both work great
with this board - well, as great as can be expected. 

Once I get my python head on, I'll be making lots of use of this!
