It's taken me quite some time (and still needs improvement) but nevertheless, I'm quite pleased with the result. I've always thought that it was possible to get god results fast with Cinema and I'm no disappointed! A little compositing with After Effects and viola! A new ident for S9. Just need to get a little music in there and I'm all set.<br /><br />I based this around the February Edition of 3D World Magazine. The tutorial was pretty good (though missing a few key points I think) and I certainly made plenty of mistakes. Sampling the different cameras and the frames needed in still before hand would have been a good idea and getting the lens effect isn't so easy. Still, job's a good'un!
