So I've left CSM and started section9.co.uk ltd and Im open for business with a new desk! :D

Im working with the University of Leeds at the moment; the strange article to the left of the photo is the current project that I can't say too much about. Im looking at a lot of WebGL work outside of that and a few physcial projects that need to be built so its all go.

Its good to be back in the swing of building cool things again though its pretty tough. I spent a while settling down to it. I hunted around London for a few different venues and settled on a shared desk with [Ping Dynasty](http://hq.pingdynasty.com/blog/) who live above [London Hackspace](http://london.hackspace.org.uk). This has proven to be quite useful. The space is close by enough so I can use the tools but I have a secure area of my own where experiments can be left and things made. It seems to work so far, though I still have far too much to get done! :D

I'd looked at other shared desk spaces and a few artist studios. The problem with the latter is a limited company is not allowed to work out of such a space. In addition the security is quite poor and the locations were not ideal. I'd looked at a proper office over near the river at the Southbank which sounded great and wasn't too expensive but the problem here was the distance from where I live, the people I seem to be working with and potential clients. The east end of London is certainly where all the cool stuff goes down.

Its scary but its a new beginning in a way and I'm quite excited! 

Unit 30, Cremer Business Centre, Cremer St, London E2 8HD if you fancy popping by for a cuppa! :D
