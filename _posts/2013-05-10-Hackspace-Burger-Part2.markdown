introtext: Its time to move onto the cheese and buns! Now I'm not a huge fan of cheeseburgers and I hate cheese slices with a passion, rivalled only by my hatred for jelly. I can't stand the stuff, especially because its basically made out of hooves!

Its time to move onto the cheese and buns! Now I'm not a huge fan of cheeseburgers and I hate cheese slices with a passion, rivalled only by my hatred for jelly. I can't stand the stuff, especially because its basically made out of hooves!

The buns in a burger are key. You need a nice, soft bun but also one that can take a sauce. The worst thing is soggy bread. No-one likes that. In our initial tests we tried sough dough bread which worked reasonably well when you consider taste, but turned out to be too chewy. Classic burger bread is more like a soft, milk roll.


In the end, Katie came up with the perfect burger. A mustard flavoured, light bap made with Creme Fraiche. We glazed them and added some sesame seeds (of course) and a little 'H' on the top. All that done, into the oven they went! You can find the recipe [Over here at the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/26/dan-lepard-mustard-buns-burgers-recipes)

Although they look quite brown, thats actually just the glaze. They are really soft but look like they could take a lot of sauce. The mustard flavouring is qutie mild but its there. Its a gorgeous bun!

Now the cheese is a different matter! I'm a big fan of blue cheese when it comes to meats. Blue cheese has the required creamy-ness but also that bitter tang. Myrhvold recommends a cheese slice made from Emmental and Comte; the latter I am a huge fan of. Comte has the tang but its not in the same league as a good blue.

Cheese slices aren't really cheese and thats the problem! It's difficult to make cheese act like a slice therefore. This is indeed a problem. However these [Wonderful folks over at Serious Eats](http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/09/the-burger-lab-how-to-make-super-melty-cheese-slices-like-american.html) have the solution!

![The results](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7385/8724784391_9bb71a0c3b.jpg)

You take your blue cheese and a can of evaporated milk. Don't used condensed milk as its far too sweet. You want about a quarter of a can to 220g of cheese I'd say (perhaps a little less depending). Melt this together, and then use a blender. 



Now, the next step is to take your gelatine (I bought mine from the eBay) and warm it up in some warm water. Stir and add to the mix. I used 2.5 teaspoons which seems about right. Whisk this with a blender again and then pour onto a try with either cling film or a silicone baking sheet.


The result is a fairly good looking slab of cheese. When we poured it out, we let it cool completely. We tried lifting the corners off the sheet but it sadly didn't seem solid enough. Katie came up with a cunning plan however. We covered the top in cling film and wound the entire lot around a rolling pin. We then placed this in the fridge overnight. This morning, we checked again and indeed, the cheese is acting like a slice.
