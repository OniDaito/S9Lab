>Im sure the pro photographers who've been at this game for a while will be able to give me some tips about shooting in the snow. I'm thinking HDR and multiple exposures as the snow must contrast too much but hey, I'm sure I'll figure it out. <br /><br />Tried another panorama. That was a lot of fun and seems to be a skill in itself! Once I get a decent flash plugin Ill get some stuff posted live.
