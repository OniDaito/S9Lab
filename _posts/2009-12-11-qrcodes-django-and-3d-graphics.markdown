>I have to say, I've never been busier in my entire life! So many things I'm working on and so little time. London certainly has that effect on people! At the moment, CASA is working on a top secret project involving QRCodes, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> and a whole host of other little technologies. Means I get plenty of Python practice with some Objective-C and C++ thrown in.<br /><br />Closer to home, I've become a big fan of <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc">OpenFrameworks</a>. C++ is still the daddy in certain circles, with graphics being the major one, especially when you code on a mac. Working on some computer vision with a NIN related theme. Tough times but all good!<br /><br />Recently covered the 'A' Gig at the Islington O2 Academy. Photos will be up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/section9">S9 Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.roomthirteen.com">RoomThirteen</a> shortly.<br /><br /><br />Since it's Friday, take a look at Flight 404's <a href="http://www.flight404.com/blog/?p=370">Cymatic Fluid</a> graphics piece. It's totally awesome!
