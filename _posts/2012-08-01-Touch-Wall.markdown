title: Building a Vertical Touch Wall
---

After watching the [Mill
Touch](http://www.themill.com/work/mill-touch/behind-the-scenes.aspx) video and after [Building my own
touchtable](http://blog.section9.co.uk/2010/09/12/touchtable-dj-decks.html), I've wanted to build a large touch wall of my own. Now that
[EMFCamp](http://www.emfcamp.org) is not far away, we have a great oppotunity to build and test
something in a field with a captive audience. So, without further ado, I've
begun the herculian task of building this thing.

The Mill use a metal frame to hold a sheet of glass as a rear projection
surface. Interference with lasers provides the blobs that can be tracked and
turned into touches. Its a fairly simple thing to try but there are a lot of
issues with this approach that boil down to filtering. First though, I needed
to learn how to weld.

Thanks to my friend Hipster Chris and the London Hackspace, we managed to get
our arc welding on. Down the road, [One Stop Metal
Shop](http://www.onestopmetalshop.co.uk) provided a good
stash of 30mm box steel. Carrying that all the way down to the hackspace was a
bit tough but I managed it. Welding is a tricky task but it seems that if you
prepare well, cleaning the surface, clamps and such, it goes a lot easier. The
rest is practice and patience. Im quite happy with the result though.

So far, the glass has actually been the easiest bit. I went on ebay and bought
a coffee table that someone didn't really want. I suppose I coul have checked
freecycle otherwise. Removing the legs and corner braces left a perfect sheet
of glass, frosted on one side. Brilliant. Tested with the hackspace projector,
the colour and brightness are pretty good.

The lasers are the tricky bit. What is needed is a set of laser units that are
safe (probably less than 10mW) and have a difraction grating to make a line,
the wider angle the better. I've bought 6 from [this chap on
ebay](http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/aixiz_lasers/&_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2754) and a
filter from [this
bloke](http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/omegabob2/&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2754) (which is apparently waiting in customs annoyingly).

I've tested the lasers and so far, things are not going too well really. One
has to properly focus the gratings and my existing filter allows too much
infrared through. Im using a PS3 eyetoy with the filter removed and an infrared
camera filter that allows anything above 780nm to pass through. Sadly, that
seems too much but hopefully the tighter filter will improve things.
