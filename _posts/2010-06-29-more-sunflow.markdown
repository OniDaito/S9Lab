It gives some lovely results, especially when using ambient occlusion like the above. I still need some nicer graphics to play with though. Siom kind of export to Sunflow from processing or Cinder would be nice (simply writing out an animation to sunflow would rock). The above image took 3 hours to render on an I7. Not quite as fast as Max but still pretty cool.</span>
