He said that the algorithms and similar were "not very interesting" and they "had too much on their plate".<br /><br />I got the impression that Mr Assange is a man on a mission who is sick and tired of the same old questions; he keeps giving the same answers and appears to be fighting quite hard. Indeed, he is learning to avoid questions quite often. <br /><br />Perhaps the real question is, what do we, as the public do? Bring them down, get involved or sit on the sidelines?
