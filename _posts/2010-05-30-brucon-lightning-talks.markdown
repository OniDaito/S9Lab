>I fancy going to Brucon this year. Managed to get my ticket sorted and maybe even a motorbike to take me there. On the volunteers list, there was talk of designing the lightning talks logo. I thought I'd step up and see what I could come up with.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TAKBPWK3RpI/AAAAAAAAAq0/8HELxdE-mLo/s1600/Lightning+Talks+Brucon+2.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 218px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TAKBPWK3RpI/AAAAAAAAAq0/8HELxdE-mLo/s320/Lightning+Talks+Brucon+2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5477082197485110930" /></a><br /><br />Feedback?

Whether this gets accepted or not, we'll soon find out.
