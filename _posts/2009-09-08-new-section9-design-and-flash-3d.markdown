>Section9 Design is now finally up and running. Had to re-learn a lot of Flash AS3. It tuns out that despite claims, there really isn't a lot of 3D stuff in there. Basics, such as Z-Sorting, Backface culling and all that, turn out not to be there.<br /><br />If you intend to do 3D with Flash, you are better off using CS4 with something like <a href="http://five3d.mathieu-badimon.com/">Five3D</a>. Papervision is the other major Flash 3D engine but it doesn't take advantage of AS3. It's probably better to use a smaller, simpler engine until the Papervision crew get up to speed with something new. Having said that, Papervision is AWESOME given that they had nothing to work with in the first place.<br /><br />SEO is always an issue with Flash. Since all the back-end stuff is powered by <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> it's probably an easy job to generate HTML. Hell, if'd been more clued up, I could have exported everything in XML and used XSLT to generate HTML for these non-flash types. <br /><br />Further work for the future no doubt!
