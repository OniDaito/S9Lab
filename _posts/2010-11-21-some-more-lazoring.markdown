I've been playing with structured light for quite a while now and I found that the setup, with the projector and camera was the most critical and annoying part. Makerbot Industries came up with a frame to hold a pico projector and PS3 Eyetoy so I thought it might be nice to have a play with it. Of course, my Kinect has now arrived so this is pretty much pointless. Need to find another use for it I think. <br /><br />At least it smells of toast! :P
