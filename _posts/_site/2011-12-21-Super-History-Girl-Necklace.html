<p>The Curator is a wonderful lady, and for her birthday and our trip to Berlin, I came up with an idea for a necklace. I wanted to make something unique and wonderful that she would appreciate and that I&#8217;d have fun making. I often joke that she&#8217;s &#8220;A super girl who saves history&#8221; and so the idea began to form.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite amazed that one can make such things quite easily nowadays. Here is how I went about it.</p>

<p>Firstly, I sketched up the idea in Ilustrator, using the path tool. Exporting these as an <em>SVG</em> allows importing into <a href='http://www.blender.org'>Blender</a>. I suppose I could have used <a href='http://inkscape.org/'>Inkscape</a> had I been thinking along these lines.</p>

<p>The SVG is converted into a set of 3 curves. You can add a modifier to these in order to <em>extrude</em> the curves a certain distance. By doing this, we end up with a 3D model from the flat curves. Remember that you need to convert this path into a <em>mesh</em> before you can export it as an <em>OBJ</em> file. An OBJ is format preferred by <a href='http://www.shapeways.com/'>Shapeways</a>.</p>

<p>Shapeways are a company based over in Sweden and I&#8217;ve used them before. They recommend using <a href='http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/'>Meshlab</a> to tidy up your OBJ file and also <a href='http://www.netfabb.com/'>NetFabb</a> which helps with the scaling. In this instance, I just guessed with Blender and kept uploading a newer version till it seemed right. I went with a bronze looking metal. 3 weeks later, it arrived at the office looking better than I&#8217;d hoped.</p>

<p>Of course, all jewellery needs a box. I figured laser cutting a box would be perfect.</p>

<p>In order to do this, I used <a href='http://www.qcad.org/'>QCad</a> and an amazing little python script called <a href='http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:404'>Boxotron</a> which creates a set of DXF files (which you can check in QCad or Inkscape). Using a laser cutter and 5mm acrylic, I came up with a box that sort of worked for me. I then took the name Katie, translated it into Japanese and exported the text as a BMP which allows for laser engraving. Placing the piece in the laser cutter was the final stage.</p>

<p>Actually, the final stage involved chatting with a jeweller at <a href='http://csm.arts.ac.uk'>Central St Martins</a> who told me that the findings and chains I would need should be bought from <a href='http://www.cooksongold.com/'>Cooksongold</a> who duly delievered the silver rope chain and other parts I needed to create the final piece.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m really happy with the result, and even happier that The Curator likes it.</p>
