<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m quite disappointed with Apple these days. The YouTube app, and indeed, any youtube support is quite poor. We&#8217;ve been working with private movies for most of the last two weeks and it seems that you simply can&#8217;t launch the correct links. Fire off a private YouTube link to the App and no joy. <br /><br />To be honest, Google haven&#8217;t been much better either. Their GData stuff only allows the grabbing of meta-data and not the actual private page or video. This is a real shame as the correct links would indeed work a treat. Not bothered about all the rest of the crappy data&#8230; we just want the video!!!<br /><br />Disappointed and haven&#8217;t had chance to do any graphic design in weeks. Still, there are plenty of photos up on Flickr as S9 has been roving around the nation&#8217;s capital!</p>
