<p>I&#8217;ve had this project on the go for a while. I&#8217;m a believer in greener energy, especially when it&#8217;s also convenient. The original solar minty boost was a lash-up between a <a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/'>Minty Boost</a> a <a href='http://www.sparkfun.com/products/726'>Sparkfun Lipoly Charger</a> and a solar panel I bought from eBay on a whim. The problem was it wouldn&#8217;t charge the lipoly battery fully, because <em>and I could be wrong here</em> the average voltage was not enough to actually charge the lipoly. The solar panel doesn&#8217;t always kick out enough volts to charge the battery, especially in the UK.</p>

<p>The wonderful Lady Ada has released a new <a href='http://www.adafruit.com/products/390'>Solar LiPoly Charger</a> which I figured would suit my needs perfectly. It has a whopping great capacitor on it which figures. Lashing this together with the existing parts resulted in the Mark2</p>

<p>The issue I had was in the housing. I thought about project boxes but couldn&#8217;t find any. I thought about using the laser cutter to make one but again, it was too bulky and too complicated. I was getting stressed until a chap called Chris at <a href='http://london.hackspace.org.uk'>London Hackspace</a> came up with the idea to use an Altoids tin. <em>Classic</em> - It works really well with a few holes cut into it and it looks the part. I added some <a href='http://sugru.com/'>sugru</a> around the usb socket and nuts to hold things in place, and also, for the <em>geek cred!</em></p>

<p>This project has cost too much and taken too much time but I&#8217;ve learnt one important lesson - Dont get too blinkered. I stuck it out but if it hadn&#8217;t been for the suggestion from a friend, I&#8217;d have never finished and gotten upset. Sometimes, it&#8217;s important to take a step back and relax.</p>

<p>Time for a field trial!</p>
