<p>For these in the London area, there is a <a href='http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Hack_Evening_Workshops'>large list of courses being held at the London Hackspace</a>. I&#8217;ll be running a Python Course towards the back end of October / Early November at Laboratory 24, Shoreditch, London. No idea of cost yet, though for hackspace members, it will likely be free. I&#8217;ll be posting here, there and everywhere once the course is finalised. <br /><br />There are many other courses available too but if you are interested, make sure you<a href='http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Hack_Evening_Workshops'> fill in the spaces on the wiki</a> as courses with no interest won&#8217;t be setup.</p>
