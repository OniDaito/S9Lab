<p>So, I&#8217;ve always wanted to have a Tron Bike. What geek hasn&#8217;t?! Well, not only that but lots of cool computer gadgets and similar all working together with an awesome looking bike and lots of cool riding gear. Well&#8230;. until I get loads of money this will have to do. I have an Old ER-5 and she&#8217;s running quite well but I like to play around and learn what I can with this bike. I had an old ASUS eeePC that was beginning to go unused and dying so I figured, lets see if we can use this as the brains for a motorcycle computer.<br /> <br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

I&#8217;ve stripped out the main board from the ASUS following a few guides that you can Google. Its quite easy really if you take the time. There are a couple of catches at the back of the keyboard you need to flip in order to lift it off properly. Once thats done, the rest is just screws.<br /><br />I decided that wedging it between some 5mm and 2mm perspex would be a good idea (actually, it may be 1.5mm - I found it in our bin). To do this, I cut a rough outline using a laser cutter and drilled four holes that would hold 4 M3 bolts. The problem is, these bolts are a little too large for the motherboard so I drilled these out a little more too! :P<br /><br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

The screen is attached with an I-PEX cable whatever that is. Annoyingly, on the I-PEX site, I cant find the same looking adaptor so I have no idea about how to extend the screen to the tank bag. This is the next step I need to solve.<br /><br />At this point, mounting the PC in the bike was a problem. The rear tray of the ER-5 is slightly too narrow to hold the PC. However, there is one, AND ONLY ONE way when it fits really snuggly. I left the PC inside the bike for about a week, where it was transported in a trailer, left out in the rain (sadly) and ridden for a good few miles. I then took it out and it still works! So far so good!<br /><br />Now the next stage is the battery. I happened to have two batteries, one being a long life one. The battery normally sits between the two prongs on the board but that is no good for mounting on the bike. If i could somehow get the battery to sit underneath, all my problems would be solved. The solution? Take the battery apart. Since they are Li-poly I figured there might be some wires and electronics before the battery proper and therefore, some leeway in moving the socket around 90-180 degrees.<br /><br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

Where are the cameras? Why is there no wii-mote attached? The answer? Because I did this on a total crazy hacker whim and its worked great so far so im just gonna wing it and see where it gets me! :P But yes, all these things considered! Next step is the software and wii-mote g sensing methinks.</p>
