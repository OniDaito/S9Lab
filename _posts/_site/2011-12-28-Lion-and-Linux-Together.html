<p>I must have spent an age getting this to work! Several forums and blog posts later I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve managed to sort this. My laptop had been suffering from slow-downs with Lion installed and the wifi had begun to break. I figured it was high-time to re-install the lot.</p>

<p>Backing everything up using an external drive, I set to with a snow-leopard DVD. No dice here folks. It turns out that OSX will only boot from a CD that either came with your machine or that has a higher version of the OS on the CD than on your hard-disk.</p>

<p>I attempted to be clever and figured I could setup Linux after Snow Leopard and created 1 partition with some freespace afterwards. Of course, installing <em>ubuntu natty</em> is a tricky beast, especially on a newer MacBook Pro. The Ubuntu forums are full of information on setting up the various versions of the Macbook. The later versions are not actually support officially. You can burn a DVD or a USB stick but to actually get Ubuntu installed you need both.</p>

<p>Thats right! Burn Natty to a CD and to a USB stick. Plug both in and then either use <a href='http://refit.sourceforge.net/'>ReFIT</a> or hold down &#8216;c&#8217; on the keyboard and boot from the CD. You&#8217;ll get into the installer and away you go.</p>

<p>The reason for Ubuntu is the PCL Cloud Libraries work better under Linux at the moment, with the Kinect Fusion stuff being only just around the corner. It&#8217;s worth pointing out that an nVidia card is needed in your MacBook Pro for the best stuff to work, I.E anything using CUDA. Not all MacBooks use nvidia hardware and I still don&#8217;t know if mine can run CUDA under Linux.</p>

<p>Anyway, trying to install Lion over the top of Snow Leopard didn&#8217;t work at all. Sadly, it seems Lion wants around 128meg extra after the Snow Leopard Partition. Fine, I figured. Lets just use <em>Disk Utility</em> to sort that out. No dice. &#8220;Mediakit reports no such partition&#8221; was the message here. Apparently, my partitioning of the disk using the Ubuntu installer had not gone well.</p>

<p>Lion uses the GUID system for it&#8217;s paritions and I figured that was worth checking. <a href='http://www.ipartition.com'>iPartition</a> allows you to do this with their boot CD but even this failed to fix the problem. In the end I just backed up again, downloaded a copty of Lion and burnt that to a DVD. I now have a bootable version of OSX Lion from which one can partition, install and get a system up and running.</p>

<p>Having said all that, it would appear that ReFIT is nowhere to be seen now, despite having installed it. Im now greated with a password prompt straight off the bat, so no idea if Linux will even install at all.</p>

<p>Not the best thing to be doing over Christmas I must admit!</p>
