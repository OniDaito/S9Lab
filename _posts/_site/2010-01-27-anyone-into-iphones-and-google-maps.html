<p>I&#8217;ve created a small application that will read your Google My Maps direct from Google and onto a map on your iPhone. It was a test and a learning curve for Objective-C and iPhone development. I&#8217;ve attempted to get it into the iPhone store but with little success. It works ok for me but there are still some bugs according to Apple. Nonetheless, I think it might be helpful for some people out there so I&#8217;ve uploaded it to Bitbucket. <a href='http://bitbucket.org/onidaito/iphonemymap/'>You can check it out here</a></p>
