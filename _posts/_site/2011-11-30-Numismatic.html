<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a small project for the excellent girlfriend involving the recognition of coins. I&#8217;ve been looking into some various different applications that attempt to do this using computer vision. Turns out its a hard program.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also learnt a new word, clearly!</p>

<p>A small program called <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/scybot-coin-counter/id445453916?mt=8'>Scybot</a> attempts to count US coins with the iPhone camera. Sadly, it doesnt work. It turns out it simply uses a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform'>Hough Transform</a> by the looks of things. I tried this and here are the results:</p>
<object height='360' width='480'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/CPrVdBdsglQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/CPrVdBdsglQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='360' width='480' /></object>
<p>Sadly, it isn&#8217;t great on coins that aren&#8217;t round or at least, not easily. It seems that perhaps training a haar classifier might be the best option? <a href='http://achuwilson.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/create-your-own-haar-classifier-for-detecting-objects-in-opencv/'>This blog post</a> is a great introduction to the idea of training a classifier. It&#8217;s an intensive task and the jury is still out on whether or not this will actually work. I&#8217;ll be sure to post my results here when I get them.</p>

<p>Currently, my classifier is still running, as has been for the last 3 days!</p>

<p>At the moment, most of the research seems to be based around the recognition of old coins as oppose to new ones?</p>
