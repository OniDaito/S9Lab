<p>So I&#8217;ve been working out how to do live Mocap with real models for a while now and I think I&#8217;ve finally got it. It still has trouble tracking based on factors I&#8217;m not sure about (the lab coat certainly doesnt help). The way that the arms snap back to their default positions when the tracking is lost is not a very good feature either but nevertheless, its definitely live mocap, thanks to the excellent work by the primesense team. Awesome!</p>
