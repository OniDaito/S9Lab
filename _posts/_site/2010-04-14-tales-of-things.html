<p>I&#8217;ve been somewhat busy with work of late. I&#8217;m involved with the <a href='http://www.talesofthings.com'>Tales of Things</a> project which goes live this Friday. It&#8217;s been a hectic time but I&#8217;ve been involved with lots of different aspects which have been quite good fun.<br /><br />We&#8217;ve been playing a lot with <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django</a> and <a href='http://nginx.org/'>Nginx</a> with our shiny new server at <a href='http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk'>CASA, UCL</a>. So far, Django has been pretty good to work with though it&#8217;s not without its faults here and there. Generally, we are pretty hopeful things will work out well.<br /><br />Using QRCodes and RFIDTags to give objects a voice is a difficult but fun problem and there certainly have been quite a few crazy ideas thrown about the office. So be sure to stop by Tales of Things when you get chance.<br /><br />One of these off the wall ideas is the use of Audio to convey memories with your iPhone:<br /><br /><object height='236' width='420'><param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><param name='movie' value='http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10928717&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1' /><embed src='http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10928717&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='236' width='420' /></object></p>
