<p>EL-Tape and EL-Wire have been around for a few years. We&#8217;ve all seen <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=tron+guy&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=AjkET63gLYra8APe-6DGAQ&amp;biw=1505&amp;bih=829&amp;sei=BzkET4PbKdD_8QOklcmhBA'>Tron Guy</a> and all the rest. For me, EL-Wire is only suitable for rigid objects. It looks naff when it&#8217;s just sewn on with no thought or style behind it. Lady Ada&#8217;s <a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/tronbag/'>EL-Wire Bag</a> is probably the best example of how EL-Wire should be used, in my humble design opinion.</p>

<p>EL-Tape has its own challenges though. It&#8217;s flatter and wider as you&#8217;d expect and there have been a few good designs out there. The <a href='http://io9.com/5708876/how-to-make-your-tron-costume-glow-with-electroluminescent-wire'>Quora</a> costumes aren&#8217;t bad and I&#8217;m sure you know of other examples. I wanted something that was work-a-day, fun and looked good without being cliche, or <em>tron-esque</em> though hinting at it of course.</p>

<p>The Curator is an excellent seamstress, among her many other talents, and I&#8217;ve been learning how to improve my own sewing skills. She came up with the idea of using an elastic, fishnet sleeve to contain the tape. We don&#8217;t actually sew the tape at all. This has many advantages. By using a spiral, the top can flex quite easily with the arm.</p>

<p>The wire for the invertor goes down the back. Im using the invertor and tape from <a href='http://www.adafruit.com/category/50'>Adafruit Industries</a> who I highly recommend.</p>

<p>The top came from Uniqlo who generally make good stuff (I&#8217;m told) and although the sewing was challenging, the material made the sewing not quite as hard as it could have been.</p>
