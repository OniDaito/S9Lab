<p>I have to admit, one needs to be really up on their CS to get with the iPhone programming if you want to do anything half interesting. I never realised the draconian rules of Apple were so harsh. Essentially, I&#8217;m working with Augmented Reality and that means getting to grips with the camera which is technically illegal. Well, sort of. <br /><br />Annoying, applications like RedLaser, Quickmark and a few others have slipped the net and used the &#8220;Screengrab&#8221; method to bypass Apple&#8217;s thought police. I wonder if we can do the same? I mean, come on! Apple have made the ultimate device for proper AR with the 3GS; enough to almost tempt me to buy one! But this sort of thing needs to stop.</p>
