<p>So far, people seem to be quite impressed with the new S9. There are some things to work on though it seems. Firstly, the buttons on the top right need some work - need to re-align the hit objects.<br /><br />Secondly, it seems that firefox on 64bit with Flash is causing issues. Not sure why. It just seems to hang. I wonder if it&#8217;ll do the same thing once I install snowleopard? We shall have to see. Finally, the movement on the cube seems to make people wonder. Some find it easy&#8230;. others not. I&#8217;ll need to check it out and get back. I want this to be right really because it needs to be. About time I got really down to details as that&#8217;s what design is about.</p>
