<p>Decided to return to the Southlands of the UK for New Year&#8217;s. Several bars in Camden, Japanese stores and Korean cafes later, I ended up on Primrose Hill for a large party and a terrific view of the capital. Sadly, I was sans camera which sucked somewhat. Still, there turned out to be a parade on new year&#8217;s day, passing through Trafalgar Square and Westminster. A great opportunity to learn about taking shots in massive crowds! No press pits here. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/sets/72157622997402307/'>Check out the latest snaps on Flickr</a>.<br /><br />Heres a sneak preview!<br /><br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:
