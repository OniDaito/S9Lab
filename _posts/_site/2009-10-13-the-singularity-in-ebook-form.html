<p>I tend to enjoy reading eBooks these days. Most of them are free, enjoyable and read well on the iPhone. E-Reader is pretty good for these with non-jailbroken iPhones. I&#8217;d also suggest that people check out <a href='http://www.manybooks.net'>manybooks.net</a>. It&#8217;s a great little website and seems to be touted by various softwares and people.<br /><br />There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the &#8220;Singularity&#8221; which is quite interesting. As Section9 is very much in the &#8220;cyberpunk&#8221; of design, we like this sort of thing. I found several fictional works on the subject, not least &#8221;<a href='http://manybooks.net/titles/munroejother05everyoneinsilico.html'>Everyone in Silico</a>&#8221; which I&#8217;m looking forward to getting into. <br /><br />Often, people think that a computing singularity will end up devouring the Earth and taking over, benign or evil or something. I always preferred Ghost in the Shell&#8217;s middle route of co-existence and co-progression. Still, Masamune Shirow was ahead of his time.</p>
