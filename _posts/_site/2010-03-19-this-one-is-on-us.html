<p>I&#8217;m a big NIN fan and Trent Reznor influences my work probably more than any other. With the release of all the material from the Vegas show and the Lights in the sky tour, there have been some great fan works. <a href='http://thisoneisonus.org/node/2'>This One is On Us</a> is a great site with DVD sets, artwork and audio downloads. I highly recommend getting the torrents going and downloading this (it&#8217;s free! You have no excuse). The audio alone makes a great listen and is possibly better than the official NIN Live DVD so get to it people!</p>
