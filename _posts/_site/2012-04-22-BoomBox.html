<p>This is of course, no oridinary boom box at all, but a rather spiffing steam/cyber punk esque box that blows up when its turned down to the red level! I&#8217;m quite pleased with it. It&#8217;s not been easy to build as my girlfriend will no doubt attest! :S</p>

<p>Why build such a thing you ask? Well, it&#8217;s to do with <a href='http://animation12.cs.manchester.ac.uk/'>Animation 12</a> which is being held this summer. The idea is to get kids at school into CS and animation and similar fields. There is a competition for the best animations and awards are presented at a large event, held at the University of Manchester. There will be a keynote which this year, is all about lag, ping times and the speed of light and how we try and get around these limitations on the internet.</p>

<p>My box is basically a prop&#8230; a fake mad scientist gadget that pretends to slow down causality! Yup, the big &#8216;C&#8217;. Its essentially a fun and graphic way of showing the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Michotte'>Michotte</a> experiment. So the idea is, after a certain point the brain believes that something isn&#8217;t causal but actually, for small amounts of time between subsequent events, the brain can be fooled.</p>

<p>The technical details revolve around an arduino (yes, everyone&#8217;s favorite IC) and a standard circuit for switching on and off large voltages. I&#8217;d like to thank Phil Eagleton for helping with the schematic. Basically, the arduino is linked to an NPN Transitor that flicks a relay. The relay turns on a 9volt current that is passed through a pyro bought from <a href='http://www.justfx.co.uk'>JustFX</a> - a small company over in Tottenham. They have lots of lovely pyrotechnics and theatre equipment which is good to know.</p>

<p>Its a fairly straightforward circuit but the thing that threw me is the notion of a common ground. Its soooo obvious, its often just assumed but in all the diagrams I looked at for transistor circuits, it simply wasn&#8217;t mentioned. I stumbled on it by accident, then had it confirmed by Phil. Marvellous!</p>

<p>So what do it do? Well here you go!</p>

<p>These Pyros are called &#8220;Robotics&#8221; and explode in a shower of sparks. They are quite vicious actually, as my swearing will attest! Clearly I have a dirty mouth!</p>

<p>Simply put 9V through them and BOOM! You have a wonderful explosion. I can&#8217;t wait to see the finished video!</p>
