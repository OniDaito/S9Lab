<blockquote><span class='bblack'>I thought I'd put down my thoughts and experiences on keeping track of your personal projects and data. I've been through a lot of various methods. Everything is intertwined; backup, code repos, security, accessibility etc etc. My method certainly wont suit everyone but it may give you some thoughts. In a nutshell, I use Apache, GIT and Mediawiki on a small MiniITX machine with USB disk cloning to run all my systems.</span></blockquote>
