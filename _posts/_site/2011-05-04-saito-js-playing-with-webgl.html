<p>So I&#8217;ve been playing a lot with WebGL and, as everything is Ghost in the Shell related here, I&#8217;ve decided to call my script Saito.js . I&#8217;ve tidied it up a little and its <a href='https://github.com/OniDaito/Saito.js'>now up on GIT</a> though it isn&#8217;t really ready for prime time yet.</p>

<p>Javascript is an odd language but I&#8217;m definitely coming Â around to it. Asynchronous requests, and dynamic binding with some closures thrown in as well? Theres a lot of power there but with OpenGL? OpenGL I&#8217;d have thought, doesn&#8217;t lend itself well to anything but classic C++ code? Nevertheless, I could be wrong. When I learnt OpenGL back in the day, it was all about glBegin and glEnd but now, with display lists, VBOs and the VAOs (which I&#8217;ve yet to play with) and Shaders being the rage now, perhaps its time to change one&#8217;s programming style.</p>

<p>The above screenshot shows my 2D curve shape class. Im wanting to get some visualisations going so we need some nice curves! :) Watch this space, much more to come!</p>
