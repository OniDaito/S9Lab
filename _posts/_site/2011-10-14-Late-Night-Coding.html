<p>I&#8217;ve been quite busy of late, again, not with the real job but my <em>real</em> job. Recently, I was up in Manchester at the <a href='http://www.amaze.com'>Amaze</a> offices, working solidly for 3 days on a kinect based project for the <a href='http://www.thelowry.com'>Lowry</a>. It&#8217;s still under wraps at the moment but progress has been made. The other partners felt the need to spend time getting the basics nailed. Working piecemeal on a project is only fine for so long. When things need to get done, the tough get going.</p>

<p>For 3 days, there was nothing but drizzle and overcast skies. It&#8217;s fair to say that Manchester&#8217;s awful weather actually helps with the Kinect&#8217;s camera. In bright sunlight, forget it! I never thought I&#8217;d be glad to see the greyeness of the north.</p>

<p>To be complete, we tested our setup in the evening also. It turned out that night-time results are better though only marginally.</p>

<p>Testing in Manchester at night does have unique problems. Standing around with a bright <em>apple</em> logo attracts a certain kind of person. A bunch of scallies decided to pop over and have a chat. To be fair, we actually learnt a lot - they were playful and wanted to see how the code worked. Some of them had only about 3 teeth which was quite worrying. Neverthess, one of them asked what I&#8217;d written the code in. I told him Cinder and he said he had written some basic &#8216;point and click&#8217; games at college. I got the impression that secretly, he wanted to be a geek. I hope I&#8217;ve helped him with that.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve caught a cold as well, I&#8217;m quite knackered, but if you are in Manchester early next month, be sure to checkout Piccadilly Gardens.</p>
