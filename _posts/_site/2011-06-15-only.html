<p>After seeing the video for &#8216;Only&#8217; by NIN, I decided I really wanted to make that work in real-time. The very first version used an infrared camera and OpenCV within OpenFrameworks and was quite a laugh really. I learnt a lot while building it. When the Kinect came out, I figured a rewrite was needed and since I wanted to learn more hardcore C++, I decided to go with Cinder.</p>

<p>On the Tech side of things, I went through a lot of different ideas, with shadows, an early version of SSAO and even a 360 Panorama shot, taken with my trusty D100. In the end, I found that the best result was to use either a texture or a webcam feed sent into some GLSL refraction, coupled with a version of SSAO that uses Poisson Discs. Its the only implementation I&#8217;ve found that runs well enough.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that using one mac, with the front and back screens stretched over two heads would work but sadly not. The framerate took a hit and doing fullscreen over two heads seemed difficult. In the end, I decided to send the raw data over a network link from the back screen, to the front. There was a small amount of latency but that actually added to the effect rather nicely.</p>

<p>Two Mac Pros were hired to run it (overkill really) but the FPS wasnt as great as I&#8217;d like. I&#8217;d thought about instancing and similar but couldnt make it work with Apple&#8217;s goddamn crappy OpenGL drivers. This will be running again in 3 weeks time and its likely it&#8217;ll be on a couple of Windows machines instead (thanks Cinder Windows peeps!).</p>

<p>The projector screen is quite special. It was made by one of the team, Andrew Robinson, who built a frame with 3 skins that stop the light from going straight through. The projectors were mounted quite high up so its possible to get very close to the screen. I&#8217;d incorporated Memo&#8217;s Quadwarp algorithm into the program to keystone in software if needed but it turns out we didn&#8217;t need to bother.</p>

<p>Plenty learnt as its my first piece really (at least, the first that I made on my own, software wise) but I had a lot of fun. Cheers Cinder guys and girls!</p>
