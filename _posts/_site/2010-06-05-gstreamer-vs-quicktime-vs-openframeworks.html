<p>I&#8217;ve been having fights with all three at the moment. Openframeworks is nice because it uses OpenGL and the C++ language which is great for computer graphics and as it&#8217;s cross platform, it&#8217;s great for OSX and Windows and Linux. Trouble is, there are some glaring problems when it comes to recording modified video. It seems that its really Apple&#8217;s fault.<br /><br />For Mac OSX, OF uses Quicktime as really, it&#8217;s the only option. Sadly, the Quicktime C bindings are no longer <span style='font-style:italic;'>in fashion</span> with Apple. This is damn shame because finding documentation on it is a pain in the arse. Now it appears that grabbing frames is fine, and there has been some sterling work in recording video back to a MOV again.<br /><br />However, this is no good if you are playing with sound as well.<br /><br />Yup, basically what I&#8217;m talking about is some kind of VJ setup. Press a button, record sound and video, modify video, save to compressed mov. Now this is do-able with the new fancy-pants-core-video but thats not much use when you want it linked to an Arduino and all the rest. So I abandoned the mac and looked at <a href='http://www.gstreamer.net/'>GStreamer</a>.<br /><br />GStreamer has some great documentation and is really easy to learn. I love the idea of their pads and bins and similar. It&#8217;s great that they have a method for running the plugins on the command line. Looking at the OF code for their linux distro, I can see why they chose it.<br /><br />So yes, Quicktime for the lose. GStreamer for the win.</p>
