<p>As well as printing out a few cases for electronics and a scan of my face, I figured I could prototype my little idea. I guess thats the real strength of the whole makerbot and printing culture. I&#8217;d tried an RFID earring before but it was pretty crap and didn&#8217;t work so well. I love the wires they use in Ghost in the Shell, like this:</p>

<p>The problem is, in Ghost in the Shell, they tend to carry an attachment which looks like a collar that contains an extendible cable. Thats fine if you have an interface direct to the brain but for us mere dreamers, its probably not going to work.</p>

<p>It does work though, which I&#8217;m quite pleased about. I designed this in Google Sketchup then exported to STL. The walls are 1.5mm thick but I reckon we could get it down to around 1mm with the printer at fablab.</p>

<p>Perhaps an RFID ring is a better idea? I&#8217;d really like to take the iCuffLink idea of Lady Ada and make that work with WiFi. Can you imagine it? A wifi pendant that glows in the presence of strong wifi! I&#8217;ll get to it! :D</p>
