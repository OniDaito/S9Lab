<p>Never really been that sure about blogging but I feel It&#8217;s part of the business these days and it provides a nice medium for keeping peopel up-to-date with events in my world, whilst retaining an informal edge. It&#8217;s nice to have that distinction from the main website. Hopefulyl that should be up very soon.</p>
