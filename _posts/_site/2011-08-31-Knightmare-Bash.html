<p>So I came up with this today:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
a=$(echo $1 | tr &#39;[:lower:]&#39; &#39;[:upper:]&#39;)
e=$(echo $a | sed &#39;s/\(.\)/\1 /g&#39;)
echo -n &quot;SPELLCASTING: &quot;
for i in $e; do
	echo -n $i&quot; &quot;
	sleep 1
done;
echo &quot;&quot;
$1</code></pre>

<p>This little piece of bash script is the geekiest and therfore <em>coolest</em> thing I&#8217;ve written for the past few weeks. But it&#8217;s had me thinking a little about programming, life and the universe.</p>

<p>It was born out of a semi-drunken chat with my good friend <a href='http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/people/person.asp?ID=260'>Steve</a>. After cooking a <em>rather splendid</em> roast dinner, the conversation turned, as it inevitably does, to TV programmes we used to watch as kids. I don&#8217;t know why that always happens after a certain age but it&#8217;s something that has occurred between my friends and I many times. I suspect it&#8217;s not just me either. Of course, we had to talk about <a href='http://www.knightmare.com/'>Knightmare</a>.</p>

<p>Steve hit on the idea of a spellcasting script of some kind so I thought I&#8217;d write one. I was bored at work this morning and figured it would be a good warm-up. I&#8217;m no bash ninja sadly, though I&#8217;ve often thought about learning more and there indeed is the rub. It&#8217;s important to take little steps and to do that, you <em>have to want to take them</em>.</p>

<p>I think this simple example is quite similar to the <a href='http://www.vimeo.com/26788575'>Thermoptic Camouflage</a> play-thing I wrote. It&#8217;s what you might call a <em>speed project</em>. It&#8217;s a little bit fun, the outcome is known, and you have a pretty good idea of what you need to do but with scope for learning and finally, most importantly, it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The last bit is important. There is no real pressure save whatever you bring to it.</p>

<p>I also wrote <em>a shit load of Ruby on Rails</em> with video processing and everything but thats beside the point! :D</p>
