<p>I fancy going to Brucon this year. Managed to get my ticket sorted and maybe even a motorbike to take me there. On the volunteers list, there was talk of designing the lightning talks logo. I thought I&#8217;d step up and see what I could come up with.<br /><br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

Criticisms? All welcome. I thought I&#8217;d try and go for something that was close to the original logo to keep continuity but also make something that looks dynamic and fast and action packed. Whether this gets accepted or not, we&#8217;ll soon find out.</p>
