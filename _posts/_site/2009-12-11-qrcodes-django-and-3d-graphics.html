<p>I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been busier in my entire life! So many things I&#8217;m working on and so little time. London certainly has that effect on people! At the moment, CASA is working on a top secret project involving QRCodes, <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com'>Django</a> and a whole host of other little technologies. Means I get plenty of Python practice with some Objective-C and C++ thrown in.<br /><br />Closer to home, I&#8217;ve become a big fan of <a href='http://www.openframeworks.cc'>OpenFrameworks</a>. C++ is still the daddy in certain circles, with graphics being the major one, especially when you code on a mac. Working on some computer vision with a NIN related theme. Tough times but all good!<br /><br />Recently covered the &#8216;A&#8217; Gig at the Islington O2 Academy. Photos will be up on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/section9'>S9 Flickr</a> and <a href='http://www.roomthirteen.com'>RoomThirteen</a> shortly.<br /><br /><br />Since it&#8217;s Friday, take a look at Flight 404&#8217;s <a href='http://www.flight404.com/blog/?p=370'>Cymatic Fluid</a> graphics piece. It&#8217;s totally awesome!</p>
