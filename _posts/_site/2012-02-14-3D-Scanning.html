<p>I&#8217;ve been interested in scanning things of late. There is a job I&#8217;m chasing that may potentially involve 3D scanning and as a project, it encompasses many things I like. So I decided to give <a href=''>123D Catch</a> a go, as it seems to be quite good from what people have posted online. Sadly, I&#8217;ve not had so much luck with it.</p>

<p>Apparently, one needs to rotate a camera around the object you want to scan, so I did just that, building a little rig out of a bicycle wheel, just like this.</p>

<p>Mounted around the rim, I placed the Logitech C910 that I use for good work. The results look like this:</p>
<object height='315' width='560'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/-KmUcCcHuoE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/-KmUcCcHuoE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='315' width='560' /></object>
<p>You can, of course, just spin the thing and record video. That looks quite cool actually!</p>
<object height='315' width='560'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/Lips-BBa138?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/Lips-BBa138?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='315' width='420' /></object>
<p>The problem is, the results just arent that impressive. Only the hat actually came out right.</p>
<object height='315' width='560'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/RQHA57jadsY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/RQHA57jadsY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='315' width='560' /></object>
<p>So I thought, maybe I&#8217;m being too clever. Lets just use some actual DSLR snaps as people seem to suggest. The best I managed was half a pig!</p>
<object height='315' width='560'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/ZVU8vY8BRc4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/ZVU8vY8BRc4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='315' width='560' /></object><object height='315' width='420'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/i2bnaICown4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/i2bnaICown4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='315' width='420' /></object>
<p>So basically, a thumbs down for 123D catch. I suspect laser scanning or improved Kinect code is the way forward here.</p>
