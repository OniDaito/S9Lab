<p>Im sure the pro photographers who&#8217;ve been at this game for a while will be able to give me some tips about shooting in the snow. I&#8217;m thinking HDR and multiple exposures as the snow must contrast too much but hey, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll figure it out. <br /><br />Tried another panorama. That was a lot of fun and seems to be a skill in itself! Once I get a decent flash plugin Ill get some stuff posted live. Until then, check out the Flickr-ness: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/'>http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/</a></p>
