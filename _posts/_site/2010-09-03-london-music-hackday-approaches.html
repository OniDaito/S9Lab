<blockquote><span class='bblack'>..and I've been asked to help out with the hardware hack section of the event. It promises to be a lot of fun and I can't wait to be there but I've been working mega hard on a large project which I hope to get finished tonight. An awful lot of cool things are in the pipelines but just not finished enough to be released.
