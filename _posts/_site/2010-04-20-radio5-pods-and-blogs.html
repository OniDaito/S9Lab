<p>Fame at last? Well maybe just a little. Jemimah Knight was kind enough to let me come on her show, <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/podsandblogs/'>Pods and Blogs, on BBC Radio5</a>. Had a lot of fun chatting to her about the project at work, Tales of Things. If you don&#8217;t want to wait to hear it this evening, <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/podsandblogs/2010/04/tedx_ratholes_and_tales_of_thi.shtml'>check out the Podcast</a> where you can download the MP3. I come in towards the end but there&#8217;s some cool stuff about TED in there too!</p>
