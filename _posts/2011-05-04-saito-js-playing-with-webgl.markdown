So I've been playing a lot with WebGL and, as everything is Ghost in the Shell related here, I've decided to call my script Saito.js . I've tidied it up a little and its <a href="https://github.com/OniDaito/Saito.js">now up on GIT</a> though it isn't really ready for prime time yet.

Javascript is an odd language but I'm definitely coming Â around to it. Asynchronous requests, and dynamic binding with some closures thrown in as well? Theres a lot of power there but with OpenGL? OpenGL I'd have thought, doesn't lend itself well to anything but classic C++ code? Nevertheless, I could be wrong. When I learnt OpenGL back in the day, it was all about glBegin and glEnd but now, with display lists, VBOs and the VAOs (which I've yet to play with) and Shaders being the rage now, perhaps its time to change one's programming style.

The above screenshot shows my 2D curve shape class. Im wanting to get some visualisations going so we need some nice curves! :) Watch this space, much more to come!
