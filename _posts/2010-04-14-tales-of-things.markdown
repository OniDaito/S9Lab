>I've been somewhat busy with work of late. I'm involved with the <a href="http://www.talesofthings.com">Tales of Things</a> project which goes live this Friday. It's been a hectic time but I've been involved with lots of different aspects which have been quite good fun.<br /><br />We've been playing a lot with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> with our shiny new server at <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk">CASA, UCL</a>. So far, Django has been pretty good to work with though it's not without its faults here and there. Generally, we are pretty hopeful things will work out well.<br /><br />Using QRCodes and RFIDTags to give objects a voice is a difficult but fun problem and there certainly have been quite a few crazy ideas thrown about the office. So be sure to stop by Tales of Things when you get chance.<br /><br />One of these off the wall ideas is the use of Audio to convey memories with your iPhone:<br /><br /><object width="420" height="236"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10928717&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10928717&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="420" height="236"></embed></object>
