>So far, people seem to be quite impressed with the new S9. There are some things to work on though it seems. Firstly, the buttons on the top right need some work - need to re-align the hit objects.<br /><br />Secondly, it seems that firefox on 64bit with Flash is causing issues. Not sure why. It just seems to hang. I wonder if it'll do the same thing once I install snowleopard? We shall have to see. Finally, the movement on the cube seems to make people wonder. Some find it easy.... others not. I'll need to check it out and get back. I want this to be right really because it needs to be. About time I got really down to details as that's what design is about.
