>For these in the London area, there is a <a href="http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Hack_Evening_Workshops">large list of courses being held at the London Hackspace</a>. I'll be running a Python Course towards the back end of October / Early November at Laboratory 24, Shoreditch, London. No idea of cost yet, though for hackspace members, it will likely be free. I'll be posting here, there and everywhere once the course is finalised. <br /><br />There are many other courses available too but if you are interested, make sure you<a href="http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Hack_Evening_Workshops"> fill in the spaces on the wiki</a> as courses with no interest won't be setup.
