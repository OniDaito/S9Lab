Saw an awful lot of good talks from various people and a couple of good workshops to boot. Props to the<a href="http://www.brucon.org/"> Brucon guys</a>, <a href="http://samy.pl/">samy.pl</a> and <a href="http://www.digininja.org/">digininja</a> for some great talks and training. Also, it being held in Belgium, the beer was good too!<br /><br />Generally, there was a lot of talk around RFID which was interesting but I don't quite see it going anywhere special just yet (especially the near field stuff) and a fair bit on XSS and similar, along with Web Application Firewalls and similar. A good selection of topics and a lot of fun.
