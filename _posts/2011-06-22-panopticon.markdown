It occurred to me, over the last few days, weeks and months, that I am being observed by many cameras. Since I'm a bit of a poser, I figured I'd make a short video of the many wavelengths and dimensions I am captured in over the course of the working day at my desk.

Its just a bit of fun but interesting nevertheless. There are also a couple mussing because the complete infrared camera feed can also be captured with the newer kinect and primesense/asus drivers. Must look into that.
