>I've created a small application that will read your Google My Maps direct from Google and onto a map on your iPhone. It was a test and a learning curve for Objective-C and iPhone development. I've attempted to get it into the iPhone store but with little success. It works ok for me but there are still some bugs according to Apple. Nonetheless, I think it might be helpful for some people out there so I've uploaded it to Bitbucket. <a href="http://bitbucket.org/onidaito/iphonemymap/">You can check it out here</a>
