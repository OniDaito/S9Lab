I wanted to come up with a way of selecting videos in a carousel but also with thumbnails and subtitles. <a href="http://www.section9.co.uk/html5">This is the result and it works quite well</a>. It's partially supported on the iPad and iPhone but there are a lot of issues to overcome with the iPhone. It's rather a shame really but it works great in normal browsers. It's probably not the best method of delivery for such a platform but at least Apple could have sorted out click and swipe events on the damn video element!</span><br /><br /><span class="bblack">I'd love to get some feedback on this because I think this has potential as a way of sorting out stories made from media.</span>
