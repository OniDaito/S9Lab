My D100 went away to be cleaned and came back....well worse apparently! One can notice problems if you look really hard. However I never realised how much I missed it. Im glad its back and so I made haste this evening to the nearby graveyard over at Hampstead.</span><br /><span class="bblack">The location is gorgeous and there are a few famous tombs there too! Im a bit out of practice and since it's monday tomorrow didn't stay too long but I managed to take what I thought was a good comeback set. I had so much fun and theres some funky video to come as well!</span><br /><span class="bblack"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/section9/sets/72157624531350138/">Checkout my little Graveyard shoot on flickr</a></span>
