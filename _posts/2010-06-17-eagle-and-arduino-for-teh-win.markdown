title: EAGLE and Arduino
---

For the main interaction of the Animation10 stand, I've needed to build a switch. Not just any switch but quite a fancy switch all told. It needs to have flashing lights, dials and an arduino in there just for kicks (and blog cred of course!). Most importantly, it needs a large red button because kids (and adults) can't resist pressing them. So first off, the prototype.

Take some breadboard, lots of wires and all the rest and you can play around with things till they either fit or break. I think I've more or less got the hang of this now so that's good news. Once that's done, a few sketches and a quick use of EAGLE, you can get a decent printout for etching your own boards.

Always be careful with which trace you use in EAGLE; bottom or top and do the reversals you need to do with any artwork or similar. Again, you want black on transparent if using positive board.

So far so good. There are more buttons to come but this is just a taster of the fun that is to come.
