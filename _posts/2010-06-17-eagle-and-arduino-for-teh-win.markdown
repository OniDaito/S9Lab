><span class="bblack">For the main interaction of the Animation10 stand, I've needed to build a switch. Not just any switch but quite a fancy switch all told. It needs to have flashing lights, dials and an arduino in there just for kicks (and blog cred of course!). Most importantly, it needs a large red button because kids (and adults) can't resist pressing them. </span><br /><br /><span class="bblack">So first off, the prototype. </span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TBpGsZ6TzyI/AAAAAAAAArE/Ub-JOJ_grrU/s1600/IMG_0048.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TBpGsZ6TzyI/AAAAAAAAArE/Ub-JOJ_grrU/s320/IMG_0048.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483773224960642850" /></a><br /><br /><span class="bblack">Take some breadboard, lots of wires and all the rest and you can play around with things till they either fit or break. I think I've more or less got the hang of this now so that's good news. Once that's done, a few sketches and a quick use of EAGLE, you can get a decent printout for etching your own boards.</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TBpHFIiCFgI/AAAAAAAAArM/KUafe9U6xL4/s1600/IMG_0056.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TBpHFIiCFgI/AAAAAAAAArM/KUafe9U6xL4/s320/IMG_0056.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483773649792144898" /></a><br /><br /><span class="bblack">Always be careful with which trace you use in EAGLE; bottom or top and do the reversals you need to do with any artwork or similar. Again, you want black on transparent if using positive board.</span><br /><br /><span class="bblack">Finally, with the schematic from Google Sketchup, we end up with this:</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TBpHc4PGS6I/AAAAAAAAArU/vUHWaicTOs0/s1600/IMG_0055.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TBpHc4PGS6I/AAAAAAAAArU/vUHWaicTOs0/s320/IMG_0055.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483774057734622114" /></a><br /><br /><span class="bblack">So far so good. There are more buttons to come but this is just a taster of the fun that is to come.</span>
