><a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/10/03/14/1732235/How-To-Make-Your-Own-iPhone-RFID-Reader?art_pos=5">This Article on Slashdot</a> is all about the RFID reader I made. To be honest, the project was not that mega hard or impressive but rather a good exercise in learning about the basics of iPhone hacking and indeed, it will lead to some interesting future applications which is really the point. <br /><br />If anyone knows how to get the iPhone to talk BACK over a serial line (rather than just listen) please PLEASE let me know how because so far I've had bugger all luck with this one. It's required in order to get the MiFARE stuff to work with standard chips (Being able to read your Oyster card or passport would be much more phun! :D )
