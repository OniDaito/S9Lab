Since the Quicktime player isn't everyone's cup of tea (though I'm told there are some cool Flash ones!) I figured it was time to get busy with Maya and create some videos. Generally, the idea is to create a sphere, texture map it, then create a path for a camera object. Once that's done, you export all the JPG shots using Maya hardware and combine them back using something like Quicktime Pro (mencoder didn't work so well sadly). The result is what you see here. Not bad for a first attempt though I suspect my trusty D100 needs a clean. <br /><br />Maya is a bit of a pain in the arse to use on a Mac I've noticed <a href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-250/">but the new Blender</a> is looking mighty fine and I'm thinking thats the way forward as it seems they've ditched their utterly pants UI. Good job guys!
