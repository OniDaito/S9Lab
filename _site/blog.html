      <p class="toppad">For the last six months, I've been working away at Queen Mary University of London. There was a large gap for the Transsiberian, but aside from that I've had a lot to learn in a short time. Starting a new job at a large organisation always involves a bit of ramping up. The first month or so, there was the usual 'getting to know the place', but now I'm right in the thick of it. </p>

      <p class="toppad">In a nutshell, the trip is totally worth it. Some people have said that it's become too touristy (apparently) or they believe it's something it isn't. One thing for sure, it's all down to you, who you are and what you plan for. Sounds a bit fruity, but if you prefer fewer stops and talking to more people, you can do that. If you are more like me, and prefer quieter cabins and more stops, you can do that too. A lot of the trip is down to your personality and the kinds of things you want to get up to. Our trip involved many small city breaks and a few countryside visits. Some people prefer to stay on the train from one end to the other. This is also possible and results in a different experience. </p>

      <p class="toppad">Lets start with the obvious - food! China has some of the best methods for cooking vegetables (and duck!) in the world. Crossing the border, I gorged myself on greens! I have to say though, Chinese food is a double edged sword. Vegetarian food is slightly harder to find. The Chinese don't really do baked goods, diary, confectionery (or anything sweet really), or decent beer! Refined sugar and ovens seem to have passed China by, which is really odd. In many ways, thinking back over the trip, Russia and Mongolia put up a really good fight for the top food spot. </p>

      <p class="toppad">Hong Kong! A city I've visited many times, around ten years ago. I'm pretty excited to be going back! However, I'm excited for another reason - Shenzen! So far, on this trip, we've not really seen much in the way of geekery; many of the hackspaces I've tried to contact either ignored me or probably don't exist. Shenzen, however, is the capital of electronics and manufacturing, possibly in the world. Our train cannot get there fast enough. </p>

      <p class="toppad">I've been pretty busy with OpenCV these days I have to say. Its been tricky to get to grips with but one thing that helps is having a good project to work on that has simple goals and can help a few people out. I've been looking at coins a lot - why, I can't possibly tell! But nevertheless, it's a thing I'm into. </p>

      <p class="toppad">So what have I been up to these last few months? I've not had a lot of chance to mess around in the graphics domain, largely because I've been working on a large project for The University of Leeds. I've been interested in computer vision for a while and this seemed like a good chance to get to grips with it. Im working on the reconstruction of meshes from multiple camera viewpoints. This leads me into the realms of stereo vision. </p>

I've managed to get some working results with the Windows drivers but there is an issue when it comes to OSX and Linux. It was decided we should build our own Gyro unit. Not knowing anything about such things, I went straight in. </p>

It still has trouble tracking based on factors I'm not sure about (the lab coat certainly doesnt help). The way that the arms snap back to their default positions when the tracking is lost is not a very good feature either but nevertheless, its definitely live mocap, thanks to the excellent work by the primesense team.

The Primesense team have done a really good job when it comes to full on skeleton tracking and its quite easy to get the positions of the various limbs, but when you are performing skinning, you need a rotation matrix. As we are dealing with 3D we need 3 axes defined. This is impossible with the kinect as it can't measure 'twist'. </p>

Im not sure what these are. Also, it took me aaaaaages to figure out how to get shaders to work in Quartz Composer as it's not very intuitive. Pull out the inspector on a GLSL patch and select the second tab. That gives you the vertex and pixel shaders. We can edit and play around with that there. </p>
