<p>I'd heard about Nginx a couple of times duing my time at UCL. My co-worker had set it up as the front-end proxy to deal with all the static requests and have Apache do the heavy lifting. Now, when it comes to building things, its a good idea to stick with what you know and actually ship, so long as things aren't broken.</p>

<p>My apache setup was broken!</p>

<p>On occasion, it would just stop working, eating all the memory and being a pain in the arse. So instead, I thought I'd look into <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> as a replacement. People I respect have said its good and I wanted to keep up to date.</p>

<p>So, I run two django instances, an SSL setup infront of mediawiki and this static blog, so a good selection of things to setup there. Virtual hosts, some way of running Python, PostGreSQL and basic security. Quite a lot to throw in, in a single afternoon.</p>

<p>However, it is wasn't for a change to my DNS I'd have most of it done by now! Unbelievable! I'm quite impressed. With the Django setup's, I released I needed something called <em>fastcgi</em> . Essentially, fastcgi allows a websever to grab info from another running process quickly through a socket. Django supports this out of the box so long as you have <em>python-flup</em> installed. So I ran <em>easy_install</em> and followed the instructions that I found [on the django page] (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/fastcgi/?from=olddocs). It took me a while to find this out and I'd gone down other routes such as <em>fastcgiwrap</em> and similar which I discounted in the end. It means you need to run the <em>manage.py</em> script with a few flags and have a socket that is accessible by your Nginx user. Also, you need to run the <em>manage.py</em> as a Nginx user which helps. The setup for a Django page with Nginx can be found <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/DjangoFastCGI">here</a> but I needed to send a few extra variables before it would work fully. I found this out from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2104723/django-nginx-url-problem">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>I needed to do this twice. Fortunately the virtual hosts setup is trivial and the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Configuration">Nginx Configuration Wiki</a> will let you know how to do it. No problems there then.</p>

<p>SSL is quite easy two with just a couple of lines needed to do the full setup, since I had some certificates and keys from my apache setup anyway. I didn't get around to changing mediawiki because I wanted to change the DNS to make a more sensible URL for that site. It doesn't look like it'll be too hard though.</p>

<p>So far, Im quite impressed with how easy it's been. I havent changed any files around and all is well. Top job Nginx!</p>
