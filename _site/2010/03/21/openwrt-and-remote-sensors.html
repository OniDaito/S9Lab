<blockquote><p>Normally, I have at least one set of photos or a new project or a video or something every sunday. Despite having a day off work, I've yet to reach any conclusions this week though many projects are in the pipeline. So far, I've been looking quite hard at Aerials and how they work. This is in preparation for more RFID work but also for Wifi-ness. <br /><br />I'm in the process of constructing a remote sensor, server station. I've chosen to base this around OpenWRT and an Asus WL-500GP. I know there are other, smaller server setup's these days (Sheevaplug might have been the better option and still may be retrofitted at some stage) but so far, things are looking good. As OpenWRT pretty much runs on anything, we can build Wifi points on the cheap.<br /><br />The plan is to make it perpetual using Solar Panels. Mount this on a roof with a webcam and bam, remote sensor station! OpenWRT is a beast to get working properly though but I <em>might</em> have just cracked it. So far things are running good save the wifi which is intermittent. <br /><br />So, aside from the test logo I did for a friend (see the Flickr Stream to the right!), there are no funky pics or vids this week :( But soon, I promise!</p></blockquote>
